                    <h2> Sabotage (Crewmate) </h2>
                    <p> The Imposters will periodically sabotage the Crewmates to gain an advantage! <br /> The ways Imposters can sabotage are: </p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li> Lights: When sabotaged, the vision radius of every crewmate in the game will decrease until it's a minimum. Head over to electrical and flick the switches back to green to turn on the lights! </li>
                    
                        <li> Communications: When sabotaged, the objective bar will hide your personal tasks (you can still do them), but you will not know what they are. Fix the radio in Communications to get your tasks back! (Note: Cameras will be disabled during the sabotage). </li>
                    
                        <li> Reactor: When sabotaged, Crewmates have 30 seconds to stabilise the reactor, otherwise it will be an automatic lose. Two Crewmates are required to fix reactor: both Crewmates must place their hand on the touch pads at the same time to stabilise the reactor. </li>
                    
                        <li> O2 (Excluding Polus): When sabotaged, Crewmates have 30 seconds to restore the oxygen supply, otherwise it'll be an automatic lose. Two keypads will highlight on the map. Both require one Crewmate to input the codes shown on the notepad at the bottom-left of the keypads to fix the oxygen supply. </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li> Sabotage: As an Imposter, you are able to cause disruption around the map that can give you the advantage and some easy kills.</li>
                    
                        <li> Kill: As an Imposter, you are able to kill the other players within the game to disrupt their progression on tasks. Note: Everytime you kill a Crewmate, there will be a cooldown before you can kill another player. This is the fastest way to dwindle the Crewmates numbers to win the game. </li>
                    
                        <li> Fake Tasks: As an Imposter, you don't do tasks. Instead, you fake tasks. Use this to your advantage to trick other players to belive you are innocent and drive suspision off you when it comes to the voting process.</li>

                    <p> As an Imposter, you can sabotage periodically to slow down the Crewmates and get easy kills. Let's explain Sabotage and Tips with Sabotage. </p>
                
                    <ul>
                        <li> Lights: When sabotaged, the vision radius of every Crewmate in the game will decrease until it's a minimum. Imposters vision will remain normal, so use this advantage to get a sneaky kill on a Crewmate that is making their way to electrical. </li>
                    
                        <li> Communications: When sabotaged, the Crewmates will have their objectives hidden from them until they fix the radio in the communications room. The greatest advantage is that the security cameras will also be disabled during this time, so use that to kill whoever is in security and leave the area quickly. </li>
                    
                        <li> Reactor: When sabotaged, Crewmates will have 30 seconds to stabilise the reactor. If the reactor isn't stabilised in that time, you will win. You can use this to kill Crewmates on their way to reactor or pause task progression for the Crewmates. </li>
                    
                        <li> O2 (Excluding Polus): When sabotaged, Crewmates have 30 seconds to restore the oxygen supply by inputting codes at two keypads. Use this time to either kill an unsuspecting Crewmate on their way to a keypad or stack with multiple crewmates on the same keypad and kill one. Although, the second way is very risky. </li>
                    
                        <li> Doors: As an Imposter, you can lock certain doors across the map that will keep Crewmates in that area of the map for around 30 seconds. Use this time to possibly hide bodies or kill when no one else is around. </li>
                    </ul>
